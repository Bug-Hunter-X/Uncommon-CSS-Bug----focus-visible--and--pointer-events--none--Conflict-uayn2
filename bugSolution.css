To resolve this issue, we can use a different approach to styling the focused input element. Instead of relying solely on `:focus-visible`, we can use a combination of JavaScript and CSS or change the structure of the HTML. The following example demonstrates using JavaScript to check for the focus event and apply the styles directly.

```javascript
const inputElement = document.querySelector('.container input');

inputElement.addEventListener('focus', () => {
  inputElement.style.outline = '3px solid blue';
});

inputElement.addEventListener('blur', () => {
  inputElement.style.outline = 'none';
});
```

Alternatively, if possible restructure your HTML so that `pointer-events: none` is not used on the parent container of the input element. This is generally the preferred solution for maintainability and accessibility.  If this isn't possible, the javascript solution is necessary.
